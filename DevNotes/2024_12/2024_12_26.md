Get the image happening
5mins
Mucking around with the xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
Do I need '</circle>'?
5 mins
Mucking around with which attributes are absolutely necessary!
Yay finally got it working - it was the quotes around attribute values!
5 mins
Mucking around trying to get the svg embedded in the readme.md
5 mins
Ok need the xmlns to get image links working in markdown!
5 mins
Mucking around with .gitignore because I have .DS_Store files now
The answer is a .gitignore with `**\.DS_Store` (the leading `**` means 'in any directory in the repo')
5 mins
Still can't get the image to appear in the readme.md in github
