Wow only a minute different from yesterday...
Should probably get a git plugin for vscode so I can see commit times... 
These are timestamps too...
Use deno to write more svg
How to import and use d3? (locally, offline)
For example to get todays date in the format I like?
Use normal import statement but then use 
```
deno cache script.ts
```
The first time to download and store things locally...
I guess this is like running npm install?
